We are excited to present our AI/Machine Learning final year school project that I will be working on alongside my partner Shadrack Ian Onjiri. We are aiming to come up with a physical model that can analyze the leaves of different plants and help identify the types of pests or diseases that are affecting them, as well as recommend remedies to deal with the problems. The project utilizes image recognition techniques to analyze the images of the leaves and identify any abnormalities or patterns that may indicate the presence of pests or diseases. We will be training a convolutional neural network using a dataset of images of leaves affected by various pests and diseases, as well as healthy leaves. The network will be able to accurately identify the presence of pests or diseases based on the images of the leaves. Once the pests or diseases have been identified, the project will use a database of information about common pests and diseases found in plants, as well as their remedies. The system will then recommends specific remedies or treatments for the identified pests or diseases. The project also aims to provide an easy-to-use interface for farmers, gardeners, and other individuals to use. The user can simply take a picture of the affected leaves and upload it to the system, which will then provide a diagnosis and recommendations for treatment. Additionally, it helps farmers, gardeners and other individuals save money and effort by identifying the issues early. We believe this project has the potential to be a valuable tool for farmers, gardeners, and anyone interested in plant health. It can be used to help identify pests and diseases early, before they cause significant damage, and recommend effective remedies. It can also be used to monitor the health of plants over time, providing valuable data on the types of pests and diseases that are affecting different types of plants in different regions.
